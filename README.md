# OrderManagementTool

## Introduction

The project aims to manage the orders more effectively, conveniently and automatically.  

Since last September, I started to purchase some milk powder and health products for friends in China in my spare time. Though it looks like not very hard, this job is time-consuming. I have to repeatly calculate the price of the products every time when people ask me the price, because the price on the website of the stores is changing all the time.  

Another annoying thing is that I have to maintain the records that users purchases the products, as next time if they want to place an order, I can immediately show them their address, which increase their customer sticky.  

I know that all what I talked above is very easy to implement it. In fact, there are many e-commercial open sources code on the Internet. But the truth is that the e-commercial website is what I am currenting doing. I just can't stop to bear such a heavy operation before the website releases.  

So that is the initial intention of this project.
